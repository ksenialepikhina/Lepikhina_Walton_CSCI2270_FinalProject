Name: Animal Guessing Game

Authors: Ksenia Lepikhina and Lindsay Walton

CSCI 2270 Final Project

This project is an animal guessing game. The program will guess which animal the user is thinking of, by asking the user a series of yes or no questions.

The game will be developed as a binary search tree. Each question will be included as a node in the binary search tree, with animals being included as the leaf nodes. As the user answers the questions, he/she will traverse through the tree, eventually resulting in an animal. If the animal that the user was thinking of is not included in the tree, it can be added by the user. The user can enter a new animal, along with a new question to differentiate the animal from the guessed animal. The new animal and question will be added as nodes in the tree, so the tree grows as the user continues to play the game. At the end of the game, the tree will be saved a .txt file. At the start of the next game, the tree will be built from the .txt file, so that the program can guess a wider range of animals as the game is played more.
